# Turtlebot and SLAM simulator
* Robot kinematics simulation
* Simulation of sensor detecting relative position of landmarks
* Sensor noise, twist command noise and wheel slip parameters can be adjusted in the .launch file
* The simulated robot is represented as a moving "turtle" frame
* Simulation of laser scan data given simulated landmarks
# Example Usage
```
roslaunch nurtlesim tube_world.launch
```
